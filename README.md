## Overview

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass

### What I learned

- For this project I used Sass for the first time. I learned to install node-sass and how to write my styles in sass syntax.

- I learned about Sass variables, Sass functions, Mixins, and partials.

- When I was building this project, I found that there was an inconsistency with the way the images were being accessed on Github vs. how they would be accessed locally. Basically, because I had created a new folder for all my styles, I would need to write the path as /images/something.svg and this would allow the image to be displayed locally as a background image. However, when launched through Git Pages, the images would not appear in the viewport. The way to resolve this was by writing the path this way: ../images/something.svg. Notice that there are two dots prior to accessing the image folder. 



### Continued development

- I want to get more comfortable with SASS functions and best nesting practices. Even though SASS makes it easy to organize CSS, I still felt like it was a mess.

- I want to dedicate more time to get current with the new SASS features.

- I want to get familiar with the command line. I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of features by not using the command line, especially with managing my Github.

### Useful resources

- [Learn Sass in 20 Minutes | Sass Crash Course](https://youtu.be/Zz6eOVaaelI) - This video was very helpful in getting me started quick while still having a basic understanding of what I can do with Sass.

- [When Sass and New CSS Features Collide](https://css-tricks.com/when-sass-and-new-css-features-collide/#:~:text=The%20trick%20here%20is%20to%20remember%20that%20Sass,it%E2%80%99s%20still%20valid%20CSS%20that%20works%20as%20intended.) - This article was very helpful in helping me work through some of the errors I was receiving while compiling my code. I couldn't understand why min() and max() were not working with different units when I was certain it should.
