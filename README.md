## Overview

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass

### What I learned

- For this project I used Sass for the first time. I learned to install node-sass and how to write my styles in sass syntax.

- I learned about Sass variables, Sass functions, Mixins, and partials.

- When I was building this project, I found that there was an inconsistency with the way the images were being accessed on Github vs. how they would be accessed locally. Basically, because I had created a new folder for all my styles, I would need to write the path as /images/something.svg and this would allow the image to be displayed locally as a background image. However, when launched through Git Pages, the images would not appear in the viewport. The way to resolve this was by writing the path this way: ../images/something.svg. Notice that there are two dots prior to accessing the image folder. Unfortunately, If written this way, I will not be able to view the images locally, but at least they'll be viewable in production. Another way to go about it, is by storing them only one folder apart.



### Continued development

- I want to get more comfortable with SASS functions and best nesting practices. Even though SASS makes it easy to organize CSS, I still felt like it was a mess.

- I want to dedicate more time to get current with the new SASS features.

- I want to get familiar with the command line. I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of features by not using the command line, especially with managing my Github.

### Useful resources

- [Learn Sass in 20 Minutes | Sass Crash Course](https://youtu.be/Zz6eOVaaelI) - This video was very helpful in getting me started quick while still having a basic understanding of what I can do with Sass.

- [When Sass and New CSS Features Collide](https://css-tricks.com/when-sass-and-new-css-features-collide/#:~:text=The%20trick%20here%20is%20to%20remember%20that%20Sass,it%E2%80%99s%20still%20valid%20CSS%20that%20works%20as%20intended.) - This article was very helpful in helping me work through some of the errors I was receiving while compiling my code. I couldn't understand why min() and max() were not working with different units when I was certain it should.
